Here we go again. Open File Fast 0.9.4 has just been released into the wild. And there is big news: with this release I'm introducing Open File Fast for JEdit!

I've spent some time refactoring OFF code, extracting search functionality into reusable module and cleaning up here and there. The result is the core functionality is now being used by Netbeans plugin as well as by JEdit plugin. They both share search engine, search dialog and options panel. Thanks to that I'll be able to release OFF for both platforms at the same time without any additional platform specific work (theoretically of course).

Besides all of above here are the changes for this release:

* underscores at the beginning of filenames are ignored (when searching for _foo.html.erb enter just foo)
* masks in options panel (hide files / move files to bottom of the results) have been changed from regular expression format to wildcard format - just use '*' as replacement for string of any length
* added indexing status indicator to search dialog.

Netbeans NBM package: "off-netbeans-0.9.4.nbm":https://github.com/downloads/sickill/off-plugin/off-netbeans-0.9.4.nbm"
