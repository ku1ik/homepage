h2. <%= @item[:title] %>

My name is Marcin Kulik.

!(photo)http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3137/2452888310_2f7870da4f_m_d.jpg! I graduated from the Akademia GÃ³rniczo-Hutnicza in Cracow, Poland with a master's degree in computer science.
I live in Cracow and I'm software engineer at "Lunar Logic Polska":http://lunarlogicpolska.com, one of Poland's largest and most experienced agile Ruby on Rails development teams.

*I'm software engineer*
I breathe HTTP. I was dealing with wide variety of web and distributed applications for several years, in various languages like Ruby, Python, Java and PHP. I'm experienced web developer with tens of web applications developed (and deployed on various setups) since now. I have also experience in developing distributed, high-availability, multithreaded Java/C# server-side apps working at 24/7/365. I always try to use right tool for right job and that's why I like to try out new technologies.

*I'm big fan of open source*
I like to have a choice. I like open standards. So I chose open source software for my everyday use.

*I'm music enthusiast*
Besides <%= link_to 'listening', 'http://www.last.fm/user/sikkill' %> to good music I'm trying to create my own sounds...
