title: Improved ruby mode for JEdit

My post about Textmate to JEdit theme converter (<%= link_to "tm2jed", "/blog/tag/tm2jed" %>) included example screenshots of JEdit running with some converted themes. However I'm using a little tweaked ruby highlighting mode which recognizes method, class and module names. It shows those names using styling defined for __FUNCTION__ type entities (not all JEdit themes include styling for it but themes converted with tm2jed use it).

If you want to have highlighting for method names in your ruby code put following xml code into first __RULES__ block in your ruby.xml file:

<pre>
<!-- method, class and modules names -->
<MARK_FOLLOWING TYPE="FUNCTION" MATCH_TYPE="KEYWORD1">def </MARK_FOLLOWING>
<MARK_FOLLOWING TYPE="FUNCTION" MATCH_TYPE="KEYWORD1">class </MARK_FOLLOWING>
<MARK_FOLLOWING TYPE="FUNCTION" MATCH_TYPE="KEYWORD1">module </MARK_FOLLOWING>
</pre>

Or just get <%= download_link "mine", "ruby.xml" %> ruby.xml file, put it into your __.jedit/modes__ directory and add this to __.jedit/modes/catalog__ file:

<pre>
<MODE NAME="ruby" FILE="ruby.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.rb" />
</pre>
