* Ability to switch searched project directly from OFF search dialog (see screenshot below)
* Information about project indexing is shown in dialog's status bar
* Fixed bug with indexing files in newly added directories
* Improved dialog layout a little

I've tested this version under Netbeans 6.5 and 6.7beta and I didn't notice any problem, however if you encounter some issue let me know.
