# About me

<img src="/images/photo.jpg" class="about-me-photo">

My name is Marcin Kulik.

I graduated from the [AGH University of Science and
Technology](http://agh.edu.pl/en) in Cracow, Poland with a master's degree in
computer science.  I live in Cracow and I'm senior developer at [Lunar Logic
Polska](http://lunarlogicpolska.com), one of Poland's largest and most
experienced agile Ruby on Rails development teams.

I live and breathe HTTP. I have been dealing with a wide variety of web and
distributed applications for the last 10 years, in various languages like Ruby,
Python and Java. I'm an experienced developer with tens of web applications
developed and deployed in various setups.

Currently I use Ruby (and Rails) as my primary and preferred tool for building
my apps. You could have seen me at a local [KRUG](http://ruby.org.pl/) meetings
or at [EuRuKo 2010 conference](http://euruko2010.org/) conference where I gave a
[presentation](http://vimeo.com/12665769) about interesting
[Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) stuff.

I also have experience in building distributed, high-availability,
multi-threaded Java server-side apps working at 24/7/365, system daemons and
tools that help programmers do their job.

I always try to use the right tool for the right job. That's why I'm always
eager to learn new technologies.

Oh, and I like to have a choice. I'm a big open standards proponent and
open-source contributor. I rely on OSS software for my everyday use. I'm a
happy Linux user since 1999.
