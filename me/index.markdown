# About me

<img src="/images/photo.jpg" class="about-me-photo">

My name is Marcin Kulik.

I graduated from the [AGH University of Science and
Technology](http://agh.edu.pl/en) in Cracow, Poland with a master's degree in
computer science.  I live in Cracow and I'm senior developer at [Lunar Logic
Polska](http://lunarlogicpolska.com), one of Poland's largest and most
experienced agile Ruby on Rails development teams.

I breathe HTTP. I was dealing with wide variety of web and distributed
applications for last 10 years, in various languages like Ruby, Python and
Java. I'm experienced developer with tens of web applications developed and
deployed in various setups.

Currently I use Ruby (and Rails) as my primary and preferred tool for building
my apps. You could have seen on me on local [KRUG](http://ruby.org.pl/)
meetings or on [EuRuKo 2010 conference](http://euruko2010.org/) where I was
giving [presentation](http://vimeo.com/12665769) about interesting
[Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) stuff.

I also have experience in building distributed, high-availability,
multi-threaded Java server-side apps working at 24/7/365, system daemons and
tools that help programmers do their job.

I always try to use right tool for the right job. That's why I'm always eager
to learn new technologies.

Oh, and I like to have a choice. I'm big open standards proponent and
open-source contributor. I use OSS software for my everyday use. I'm happy
Linux user since 1999.
