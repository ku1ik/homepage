## About me

<img src="/images/photo.jpg" class="about-me-photo">

My name is Marcin Kulik.

I graduated from the Akademia GÃ³rniczo-Hutnicza in Cracow, Poland with a master's degree in computer science.
I live in Cracow and I'm senior developer at [Lunar Logic Polska](http://lunarlogicpolska.com), one of Poland's largest and most experienced agile Ruby on Rails development teams.

I breathe HTTP. I was dealing with wide variety of web and distributed applications for several years, in various languages like Ruby, Python, Java and PHP. I'm experienced web developer with tens of web applications developed (and deployed on various setups) since now. Currently I use Ruby (and Rails) as my primary and prefered tool for building my apps.

I have also experience in developing distributed, high-availability, multithreaded Java server-side apps working at 24/7/365, system daemons and even tools that help programmers do their job.

I always try to use right tool for right job and that's why I like to try out new technologies. And I like to have a choice. I like open standards. So I chose open source software for my everyday use. I'm happy Linux user since 1999.
